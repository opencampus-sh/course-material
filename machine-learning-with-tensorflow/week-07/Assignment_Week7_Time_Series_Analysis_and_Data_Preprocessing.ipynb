    "\n",
    "Time series data often contains valuable information based on the use case that can be engineered from the existing dataset. An example would be features such as day of the week, weekends, week of the year, etc. In order to practice these possible feature engineering steps perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the `Date Time` column create features for the day, month, year, hour and minute.\n",
    "2. Based on these new features also create additional features such as a binary indicator if it is weekend or not (alternativly if it is weekday or not), what day of the week and what week of the year it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some features additional feature engineering could be beneficial. Cyclical features such as the day of the week, the month or the week of the year could benefit from a representation where the value representing \"Monday\" is closer to the value representing \"Sunday\" than it is when simply encoding the days like this for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monday: 0\n",
    "- Tuesday: 1\n",
    "- Wedneyday: 2\n",
    "- Thursday: 3\n",
    "- Friday: 4\n",
    "- Saturday: 5\n",
    "- Sunday: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the cyclicity of such features cyclical encoding with sine/cosine transformation can be used as one possible approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Research how cyclical encoding of cyclical features can be done and implement it for all features in the dataset where you find it suitable. Give a reason for choosing exactly the features you chose.\n",
